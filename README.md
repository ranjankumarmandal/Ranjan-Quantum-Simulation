## About
This project is an open-source Quantum Simulation platform designed to make quantum computing more accessible. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop graphical interface for building quantum circuits and automatically generates the corresponding Python simulation code.

In addition, the application includes an integrated Jupyter Notebook environment, enabling users to run the generated code directly within the platform â€” no external setup required. This combination of visual circuit design and in-app code execution makes it a versatile tool for learning, experimenting, and contributing to Quantum Deep Learning research.
